## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 18d758a: Editorial pass across spec/ and src/ docs: convert relative-path text references (e.g. `plugin-kv-api.md`, `schemas/node.schema.json`) to proper markdown links, so they resolve on GitHub and in renderers. No normative or behavioural changes — prose, schemas, and CLI contract are unchanged.
- b6c46f8: Pin all dependencies to exact versions in `src/package.json` (no `^` / `~` ranges). Matches the new repo-wide rule in `AGENTS.md`. No runtime behaviour change — all versions match what the lockfile already resolves to. Re-evaluate when `src/` flips to public (published libs usually prefer caret ranges so consumers can dedupe).
- 48c386b: First npm publish of `@skill-map/cli` — name registration. The package was previously private; flipping `private: false` plus adding `publishConfig.access: public` lets the next "Version Packages" merge publish to the npm registry under the `@skill-map` org alongside `@skill-map/spec`. Status remains preview / pre-1.0 (Steps 0a-3 done; full scan lands at Step 4). Subsequent releases follow the standard changeset flow.
- Updated dependencies [18d758a]
  - @skill-map/spec@0.5.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 128a678: Step 1a — Storage + migrations.

  Lands `SqliteStorageAdapter` behind `StoragePort`. Uses a bespoke `NodeSqliteDialect` for Kysely (Kysely's official `SqliteDialect` ships `better-sqlite3` — native, forbidden by Decision #7; the kernel runtime is Node 24+ with zero native deps). The dialect reuses Kysely's pure-JS `SqliteAdapter` / `SqliteIntrospector` / `SqliteQueryCompiler` and plugs a minimal Driver over `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync`. CamelCasePlugin bridges camelCase TypeScript field names to the spec-mandated snake_case SQL.

  The migrations runner (`src/kernel/adapters/sqlite/migrations.ts`) discovers `NNN_snake_case.sql` files, diffs them against the `config_schema_versions` ledger (scope = `kernel`, owner = `kernel`), and applies pending files inside per-file `BEGIN / COMMIT` transactions. The ledger insert and `PRAGMA user_version` update share the migration's transaction so partial success can't drift the state. Auto-backup fires before any apply — WAL checkpoint then file copy to `.skill-map/backups/skill-map-pre-migrate-v<N>.db`. `tsup.config.ts` gained an `onSuccess` hook that copies `src/migrations/` to `dist/migrations/`; `package.json#files` now includes `migrations/` so published artifacts ship the SQL.

  `src/migrations/001_initial.sql` provisions every kernel table from `spec/db-schema.md`: 3 `scan_*`, 5 `state_*`, 3 `config_*` with full CHECK constraints (enum guards on kind / stability / confidence / severity / job status / failure reason / runner / execution kind / execution status / schema version scope / boolean verified flag / boolean config_plugins.enabled), every named index declared in the spec, and the unique partial index on `state_jobs(action_id, node_id, content_hash) WHERE status IN ('queued','running')` that enforces the duplicate-job detection contract from `spec/job-lifecycle.md`.

  `sm db` command surface (per `spec/cli-contract.md` §Database):

  - `sm db backup [--out <path>]` — WAL checkpoint + file copy.
  - `sm db restore <path> [--yes]` — copies source over target and clears stale WAL sidecars; destructive, prompts by default.
  - `sm db reset [--state] [--hard] [--yes]` — default truncates `scan_*` (non-destructive, no prompt); `--state` also truncates `state_*`; `--hard` removes the DB file and its sidecars. Destructive modes prompt by default.
  - `sm db shell` — spawns the system `sqlite3` binary with inherited stdio; ENOENT produces a pointed error pointing at the install steps for macOS / Debian / Ubuntu and the `sm db dump` fallback.
  - `sm db dump [--tables ...]` — `sqlite3 -readonly path .dump` to stdout.
  - `sm db migrate [--dry-run|--status|--to <n>|--no-backup]` — default applies pending; `--status` prints applied vs pending; `--dry-run` previews without writing; `--to` caps the applied range; `--no-backup` skips the pre-apply copy.

  `--kernel-only` and `--plugin <id>` from the CLI contract are deferred to Step 1b when the plugin loader introduces plugin-authored migrations; they would be no-ops today.

  Acceptance test (`src/test/storage.test.ts`) covers the ROADMAP §Step 1a round-trip — fresh scope → migrate --dry-run → apply → write a row → backup → "corrupt" the row → restore → verify the original row came back — plus narrower checks around CamelCasePlugin field mapping, CHECK constraint enforcement at the DB layer, and the unique partial index behaviour (duplicate queued job rejected, same tuple allowed once the blocking job completes). 24 of 24 tests pass.

  Classification: minor per `spec/versioning.md` §Pre-1.0 (`0.Y.Z`). First real feature surface after the Step 0b bootstrap; `skill-map` bumps `0.2.0 → 0.3.0`.

- a0e6578: Step 1b — Registry + plugin loader.

  Wires AJV Draft 2020-12 validation against the schemas published by `@skill-map/spec` and ships the default `PluginLoader` implementation on top of it.

  **`src/kernel/adapters/schema-validators.ts`** compiles 17 reusable validators from the spec (11 top-level + 6 extension-kind). A single Ajv instance is used so `$ref` resolution works across `allOf` composition (every extension kind extends `extensions/base` via `allOf`). Supporting schemas (frontmatter, summaries) register first so targets resolve during compile. Eager compilation at load time means a spec corruption is a hard boot error, not a deferred surprise. `ajv-formats` is enabled for `uri` / `date` / `date-time`. A dedicated `validatePluginManifest()` targets `plugins-registry.schema.json#/$defs/PluginManifest` so callers don't hand-filter the combined `oneOf`.

  **`src/kernel/types/plugin.ts`** hand-writes the plugin-surface types (`IPluginManifest`, `TPluginStorage`, `ILoadedExtension`, `IDiscoveredPlugin`, `TPluginLoadStatus`). Per the updated DTO-gap note, this hand-curated mirror stays in place until Step 2's real adapter arrives as a third consumer that justifies a canonical typed-DTO export from `@skill-map/spec`.

  **`src/kernel/adapters/plugin-loader.ts`** implements the full load pass:

  1. Discover plugin directories under the configured search paths; each direct child containing a `plugin.json` is a plugin root.
  2. Parse + AJV-validate the manifest — any failure (JSON parse error, schema mismatch, malformed `specCompat` range) returns `status: 'invalid-manifest'`.
  3. `semver.satisfies(installedSpecVersion, manifest.specCompat)` with `includePrerelease: true` — mismatch returns `status: 'incompatible-spec'` with the manifest preserved for diagnostics.
  4. Dynamic-import every path in `manifest.extensions[]`, expecting a default export with a string `kind` field. File missing, import failure, missing/unknown kind, or default export failing its kind schema all return `status: 'load-error'` with a precise reason.

  Never throws — the kernel always keeps booting, regardless of how broken a plugin is.

  **CLI: `sm plugins list / show / doctor`** land in `src/cli/commands/plugins.ts`:

  - `list` tabulates discovered plugins with a status glyph and either their extension list (on success) or their failure reason.
  - `show <id>` dumps a single plugin's manifest + extensions + load status; exit 5 when not found.
  - `doctor` returns exit 0 when every plugin loads, exit 1 otherwise — script-friendly readiness check.

  All three support `-g / --global` (global scope only), `--plugin-dir <p>` (explicit override, handy for tests), and `--json` on list / show. The `module` field on loaded extensions is omitted from JSON output to avoid circular-reference serialization errors.

  **Side fix** surfaced while wiring AJV against the extension-kind schemas: the six kind schemas paired `additionalProperties: false` with `allOf: [{ $ref: base.schema.json }]`, a Draft 2020-12 composition footgun where each sub-schema applies its closed-content rule independently. The fix (shipped as a `@skill-map/spec` patch in the same commit train) switches kind schemas to `unevaluatedProperties: false` and removes closure from base; closed-content now survives the allOf composition.

  **Spec resolution**: `@skill-map/spec`'s `exports` field does not expose `package.json`, so `require.resolve('@skill-map/spec/package.json')` fails with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. Both `resolveSpecRoot()` in the validators and `installedSpecVersion()` in the loader now resolve `@skill-map/spec/index.json` (always exported) and walk one directory up. Zero spec-side changes needed.

  **Acceptance test** (`src/test/plugin-loader.test.ts`) codifies the ROADMAP criterion across 8 cases: empty search paths return `[]`; a green-path plugin with one detector extension loads and reports its extensions; both `invalid-manifest` sub-cases (missing required fields, unparseable JSON) surface; `incompatible-spec` preserves the manifest for diagnostics; both `load-error` sub-cases (missing extension file, default export failing its kind schema) surface; and a mixed scenario proves the kernel keeps going when one plugin in the search path is bad.

  Classification: minor per `spec/versioning.md` §Pre-1.0. Second feature surface after Step 1a; `skill-map` bumps `0.3.0 → 0.4.0`.

  Deferred to Step 2: `sm db migrate --kernel-only` / `--plugin <id>` (wait for real plugin migrations + triple protection), plugin-authored migrations themselves (require SQL AST parsing + prefix injection), and closing the typed-DTO gap.

- 8bda522: Step 1c — Orchestrator + CLI dispatcher + introspection.

  Closes Step 1 (all three sub-steps done). Three deliverables land in this bump:

  **Real scan orchestrator.** `src/kernel/orchestrator.ts` replaces the Step 0b stub with a pipeline that actually walks the Registry — pulling adapters, detectors, and rules from the registered set, iterating in canonical order, and emitting `scan.started` / `scan.completed` through a `ProgressEmitterPort`. The kernel-empty-boot invariant is preserved because with zero extensions the iteration produces a zero-filled valid `ScanResult`. Concrete extension runtime interfaces (`adapter.walk()`, `detector.detect()`, `rule.evaluate()`) are not yet defined; the iteration sites carry `TODO(step-2)` markers so the Step 2 drop-in test stays honoured. New adapter `InMemoryProgressEmitter` handles default in-process event fan-out; WebSocket-backed emitter lands at Step 13.

  **Full CLI surface.** `src/cli/commands/stubs.ts` ships 35 Clipanion command classes covering every verb from `spec/cli-contract.md` that doesn't yet have a real implementation. Each stub registers the final path with the contract's declared flags typed correctly (boolean vs string vs array) and a `Usage` block carrying category / description / details — so `sm help` sees the full surface today and the drift-check script has something to diff against. `execute()` writes a one-liner pointing at the Step that will implement it and returns exit 2. Grouped by module in contract order: setup (init, doctor), config (5), browse (list/show/check/findings/graph/export/orphans*), actions, jobs (submit/list/show/preview/claim/run/status/cancel/prune), record, history, plugins toggle (enable/disable), audits, serve. Real commands from Step 1a (`sm db *`) and Step 1b (`sm plugins list/show/doctor`) + `sm scan`+`sm version` stay on their real implementations.

  **Introspection: `sm help --format human|md|json`.** `src/cli/commands/help.ts` walks `this.cli.definitions()` to introspect every registered verb. `human` delegates to Clipanion's own `cli.usage()` so the terminal output matches the built-in exactly. `json` emits a structured surface dump matching `cli-contract.md` §Help — `{ cliVersion, specVersion, globalFlags, verbs[] }` with each verb carrying `{ name, category, description, details, examples, flags[] }`. `md` emits canonical markdown grouped by category. Single-verb mode (`sm help scan --format json`) emits one block. Unknown verb returns exit 5; unknown format returns exit 2.

  **Auto-generated `docs/cli-reference.md`.** `scripts/build-cli-reference.mjs` runs `sm help --format md` via tsx and writes the result to `docs/cli-reference.md` (290 lines, 6.5 KB). Root package.json gains `cli:reference` (regenerate) and `cli:check` (CI drift check — exits 1 on mismatch with a pointer to the regenerate command). `cli-contract.md` mandates this file is NOT hand-edited in the reference impl; the CI check enforces that.

  **Acceptance test green.** The `kernel-empty-boot` conformance case runs end-to-end through the real `bin/sm.mjs` → real `runScan()` path (no longer via the stub). 36 of 36 tests pass — 32 prior + 4 new covering scan event emission, empty-registry orchestrator iteration, and InMemoryProgressEmitter subscribe/unsubscribe.

  Classification: minor per `spec/versioning.md` §Pre-1.0. Third feature surface after Steps 1a and 1b; `skill-map` bumps `0.4.0 → 0.5.0-pre` territory in the roadmap scheme, formally landing as a minor bump.

- eedaf90: Step 2 — First extension instances.

  Ships the reference implementation's eight built-in extensions and the orchestrator wiring that turns `sm scan` from a zero-filled stub into a real pipeline.

  **Runtime contracts** (`src/kernel/extensions/`): five TypeScript interfaces mirroring the six extension-kind manifest schemas — `IAdapter`, `IDetector`, `IRule`, `IRenderer`, `IAudit`. A plugin's default export IS the runtime instance: the manifest fields (`id`, `kind`, `version`, `stability`, …) and the callable method(s) (`walk`, `detect`, `evaluate`, `render`, `run`) live on the same object, so ESM dynamic imports don't need a `new` dance.

  **Shared utility `trigger-normalize`**: the six-step Unicode pipeline (NFD → strip `Mn` → lowercase → separator unification → whitespace collapse → trim) from `spec/architecture.md` §Detector trigger normalization. Every detector that emits invocation-style links uses it; the `trigger-collision` rule keys on its output.

  **Adapter: `claude`.** Walks Claude Code's on-disk conventions (`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, plus `notes/**/*.md` and a catch-all → `note`), parses frontmatter via js-yaml (tolerant of malformed YAML), uses an async iterator so large scopes don't buffer, and honours a default ignore set (`.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `.skill-map`) plus any extras the caller passes.

  **Detectors: `frontmatter`, `slash`, `at-directive`.** Frontmatter extracts structured refs from `metadata.supersedes[]`, `supersededBy` (inverted so the edge points from the new node), `requires[]`, `related[]`. Slash matches `/<command>` tokens in the body with namespace support (`/skill-map:explore`), dedupes on normalized trigger. At-directive matches `@<handle>` with email filtering (`foo@bar.com` skipped) and both scope/name and ns:verb namespaces.

  **Rules: `trigger-collision`, `broken-ref`, `superseded`.** Trigger-collision buckets links by `trigger.normalizedTrigger` and emits error for any bucket with ≥2 distinct targets. Broken-ref resolves path-style targets against `node.path` and trigger-style targets against `frontmatter.name` (normalized, with the leading sigil stripped) — warn severity because authors commonly reference external artifacts. Superseded surfaces every `metadata.supersededBy` as an info finding on the source node.

  **Renderer: `ascii`.** Plain-text dump grouped by node kind, then links, then issues. Minimal — mermaid/dot live as later drop-ins.

  **Audit: `validate-all`.** Post-scan consistency check via AJV against `node.schema.json` / `link.schema.json` / `issue.schema.json`. Plugin manifests are already validated at load time by the PluginLoader (Step 1b), so this audit focuses on user content.

  **Orchestrator wire-up.** `runScan()` now actually iterates: for each adapter, walk roots → classify → build Node (sha256 body/frontmatter hashes, triple-split bytes, stability/version/author denormalised), feed scope-appropriate detectors, collect links, denormalise `linksOutCount` / `linksInCount`, then run every rule over the graph. Links emitting a kind outside the detector's declared `emitsLinkKinds` allowlist are silently dropped.

  **`sm scan`** defaults to the built-in set and exits 1 when the scan surfaces issues (per `cli-contract.md` §Exit codes). A new `--no-built-ins` flag reproduces the kernel-empty-boot zero-filled parity for conformance.

  **Drop-in proof.** The orchestrator iterates `registry.all('<kind>')` — adding a 4th detector is one new file under `src/extensions/detectors/` plus one entry in `src/extensions/built-ins.ts`. Zero kernel edits. Step 4's `external-url-counter` ships as the live proof.

  **Tests.** 52 new tests across normalization, claude adapter, three detectors, three rules, ascii renderer, validate-all audit, and an end-to-end scan against a fixture — 88 of 88 passing. The test glob widened to pick up the colocated `extensions/**/*.test.ts` and `kernel/**/*.test.ts` files that match the `src/extensions/README.md` convention ("each extension is a directory with a manifest + implementation + a sibling `*.test.ts`").

  **Side touches.** `js-yaml` now runs on both sides of the workspace boundary (ui had it since Step 0c; the adapter brings it to src). `docs/cli-reference.md` regenerated to reflect the new `--no-built-ins` flag on `sm scan`.

  Classification: minor per `spec/versioning.md` §Pre-1.0. Fourth feature surface after Steps 1a / 1b / 1c; `skill-map` bumps to the next minor.

- Updated dependencies [2699276]
  - @skill-map/spec@0.5.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3e89d8f: Bump minimum Node version to **24+** (active LTS since October 2025).

  - `engines.node: ">=24.0"` in the reference-impl package.json (root + `src/`).
  - `@types/node` bumped to `^24.0.0`.
  - ROADMAP Decision #1, Stack conventions, and AGENTS.md aligned.

  Rationale: Node 22.5 gave us stable `node:sqlite` but 24 is now the active LTS (Node 22 enters maintenance Oct 2026). The jump buys built-in WebSocket (unblocks Step 13 without a `ws` dependency), the modern ESM loader API, and several runtime improvements Kysely / Clipanion already rely on. No known dependency blocks the bump. Users still on Node 20 are already outside LTS and are not supported.

### Patch Changes

- 5935948: Align kernel domain types with `spec/schemas/`. The Step 0b stub types for `Node`, `Link`, `Issue`, `Extension`, and `PluginManifest` were invented names that diverged from the normative schemas; they compiled only because the `runScan` stub never materialized any instance. This patch closes the drift before Step 4 starts consuming the types in earnest.

  - **`Node`** now matches `node.schema.json`: `path`, `kind`, `adapter`, `bodyHash`, `frontmatterHash`, `bytes` (triple-split `{ frontmatter, body, total }`), `linksOutCount`, `linksInCount`, `externalRefsCount` required; `title`, `description`, `stability`, `version`, `author`, `frontmatter`, `tokens` optional. Removed ad-hoc `name` / `metadata`.
  - **`Link`** now matches `link.schema.json`: `source` (was `from`), `target` (was `to`), `kind` (new discriminator `invokes | references | mentions | supersedes`), `confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'` (was `exact | fuzzy`), `sources: string[]` (was singular `detector`), `trigger: { originalTrigger, normalizedTrigger } | null` (was flat top-level), plus optional `location`, `raw`.
  - **`Issue`** now matches `issue.schema.json`: `ruleId` (was `rule`), `severity: 'error' | 'warn' | 'info'` (was `'warning'`), `nodeIds` (was `nodes`), plus optional `linkIndices`, `detail`, `fix`, `data`. Removed top-level `id` (DB-only autoincrement, not in the schema).
  - **`Extension`** extended with `version` (required), plus optional `description`, `stability`, `preconditions`, `entry` — matches `spec/schemas/extensions/base.schema.json`.
  - **`PluginManifest`** renamed `entries` → `extensions` (string paths); added `description`, `storage` (`oneOf` `kv | dedicated`), `author`, `license`, `homepage`, `repository` — matches `spec/schemas/plugins-registry.schema.json`.
  - New exported types: `NodeKind`, `LinkKind`, `Confidence`, `Severity`, `Stability`, `TripleSplit`, `LinkTrigger`, `LinkLocation`, `IssueFix`, `PluginStorage`.
  - **Tests**: imports normalized from `.ts` → `.js` (runtime-correct with `verbatimModuleSyntax`). `tsconfig.include` now lists `test/**/*`; `exclude` no longer skips `test` — typecheck covers tests going forward. Added coverage for `sm scan <roots...> --json` passing custom roots through. Dead copy-paste (`void k`) removed from the ISO-8601 test.
  - **Conformance runner cleanup**: removed `PATH_SEP` re-export (consumers import `sep` from `node:path` directly) and `caseFixturePath` helper (dead parameter, zero consumers). `assertSpecRoot` retained as defensive API.

  Classification: patch. Public types were unreleased Step 0b stubs; no consumer relied on the old shapes. The changes are corrections toward the already-published spec contract, not new behaviour.

- 1455cb1: Fix `sm version`: the `spec` line now reports the `@skill-map/spec` npm package version (e.g. `0.2.0`) instead of the `index.json` payload-shape version (which was `0.0.1` in every release).

  The CLI was reading `specIndex.specVersion`, which the spec renamed to `indexPayloadVersion` in the same release and was never the right field for this purpose — the payload version tracks changes to `index.json`'s own shape, not the spec a user is running against. `sm version` now reads `specIndex.specPackageVersion` (new top-level field in `@skill-map/spec`, populated from `spec/package.json.version`).

  Requires `@skill-map/spec` ≥ the release that introduces `specPackageVersion`. No CLI surface change; only the value changes in the output line.

### Minor Changes

- 5b3829a: Step 0b — Implementation bootstrap:

  - `src/` workspace scaffolded (TypeScript strict, Node ESM, tsup build, tsx test loader).
  - Hexagonal skeleton: 5 ports (`StoragePort`, `FilesystemPort`, `PluginLoaderPort`, `RunnerPort`, `ProgressEmitterPort`) + `Registry` covering the six extension kinds + kernel shell + `runScan` stub that returns a well-formed empty `ScanResult`.
  - CLI (Clipanion v4): `sm --version`, `sm --help`, `sm scan [roots...] [--json]`. Binary wrapper at `bin/sm.mjs`.
  - Contract test runner (`src/conformance/index.ts`): loads a case JSON, provisions a tmp scope, invokes the binary, evaluates 5 of 6 assertion types (`file-matches-schema` marked NYI — lands with Step 2 when ajv is introduced).
  - Unit + integration tests with `node:test`: 13 tests covering the Registry, kernel, CLI surface, and conformance runner.
  - CI extended with `build-test` job (typecheck + tsup + tests).

  First cut of the reference implementation.
