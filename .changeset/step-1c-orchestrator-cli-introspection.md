Step 1c — Orchestrator + CLI dispatcher + introspection.

Closes Step 1 (all three sub-steps done). Three deliverables land in this bump:

**Real scan orchestrator.** `src/kernel/orchestrator.ts` replaces the Step 0b stub with a pipeline that actually walks the Registry — pulling adapters, detectors, and rules from the registered set, iterating in canonical order, and emitting `scan.started` / `scan.completed` through a `ProgressEmitterPort`. The kernel-empty-boot invariant is preserved because with zero extensions the iteration produces a zero-filled valid `ScanResult`. Concrete extension runtime interfaces (`adapter.walk()`, `detector.detect()`, `rule.evaluate()`) are not yet defined; the iteration sites carry `TODO(step-2)` markers so the Step 2 drop-in test stays honoured. New adapter `InMemoryProgressEmitter` handles default in-process event fan-out; WebSocket-backed emitter lands at Step 12.

**Full CLI surface.** `src/cli/commands/stubs.ts` ships 35 Clipanion command classes covering every verb from `spec/cli-contract.md` that doesn't yet have a real implementation. Each stub registers the final path with the contract's declared flags typed correctly (boolean vs string vs array) and a `Usage` block carrying category / description / details — so `sm help` sees the full surface today and the drift-check script has something to diff against. `execute()` writes a one-liner pointing at the Step that will implement it and returns exit 2. Grouped by module in contract order: setup (init, doctor), config (5), browse (list/show/check/findings/graph/export/orphans*), actions, jobs (submit/list/show/preview/claim/run/status/cancel/prune), record, history, plugins toggle (enable/disable), audits, serve. Real commands from Step 1a (`sm db *`) and Step 1b (`sm plugins list/show/doctor`) + `sm scan` + `sm version` stay on their real implementations.

**Introspection: `sm help --format human|md|json`.** `src/cli/commands/help.ts` walks `this.cli.definitions()` to introspect every registered verb. `human` delegates to Clipanion's own `cli.usage()` so the terminal output matches the built-in exactly. `json` emits a structured surface dump matching `cli-contract.md` §Help — `{ cliVersion, specVersion, globalFlags, verbs[] }` with each verb carrying `{ name, category, description, details, examples, flags[] }`. `md` emits canonical markdown grouped by category. Single-verb mode (`sm help scan --format json`) emits one block. Unknown verb returns exit 5; unknown format returns exit 2.

**Auto-generated `docs/cli-reference.md`.** `scripts/build-cli-reference.mjs` runs `sm help --format md` via tsx and writes the result to `docs/cli-reference.md` (290 lines, 6.5 KB). Root package.json gains `cli:reference` (regenerate) and `cli:check` (CI drift check — exits 1 on mismatch with a pointer to the regenerate command). `cli-contract.md` mandates this file is NOT hand-edited in the reference impl; the CI check enforces that.

**Acceptance test green.** The `kernel-empty-boot` conformance case runs end-to-end through the real `bin/sm.mjs` → real `runScan()` path (no longer via the stub). 36 of 36 tests pass — 32 prior + 4 new covering scan event emission, empty-registry orchestrator iteration, and InMemoryProgressEmitter subscribe/unsubscribe.

Classification: minor per `spec/versioning.md` §Pre-1.0. Third feature surface after Steps 1a and 1b; `skill-map` bumps `0.4.0 → 0.5.0-pre` territory in the roadmap scheme, formally landing as a minor bump.
