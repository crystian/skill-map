"skill-map": patch
---

Fix `sm version`: the `spec` line now reports the `@skill-map/spec` npm package version (e.g. `0.2.0`) instead of the `index.json` payload-shape version (which was `0.0.1` in every release).

The CLI was reading `specIndex.specVersion`, which the spec renamed to `indexPayloadVersion` in the same release and was never the right field for this purpose — the payload version tracks changes to `index.json`'s own shape, not the spec a user is running against. `sm version` now reads `specIndex.specPackageVersion` (new top-level field in `@skill-map/spec`, populated from `spec/package.json.version`).

Requires `@skill-map/spec` ≥ the release that introduces `specPackageVersion`. No CLI surface change; only the value changes in the output line.
